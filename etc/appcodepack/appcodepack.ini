; [@[#[!SF.DEV-ONLY!]#]@] ; do not remove this line, it is for safety to dissalow this file to be send in a release package
; HINTS:
; 	* [@[#[!SF.DEV-ONLY!]#]@] signature (as comment) in the header of a code file (php, js, css) or in the header of a setting file (ini, yaml) will dissalow that file to be added to the deploy package ; they are explicit marked as development only files
; 	* [@[#[!NO-STRIP!]#]@] signature (as comment) in the header of a code file (php, js, css) will dissalow that file to be minified and will be just added to the deploy package as it is, without minification ; they are explicit marked as files that should not be minified
; 	* if used, these signatures must be placed (as comments) at the begining of a file, in the first 1024 bytes of that file, the app code release manager will look for this signatures
; 	* if a folder contains a file named `sf-dev-only.nopack` this folder and all it's sub-folders will be ignored not added to the deploy package, they are explicit marked as development only folders
; 	* to exclude other file types or folders without using the methods above described can be done by explicit ignore them in the appcodepack.yaml settings
; 	* the appcodepack.yaml settings file contains options to allow also rename files or folders when packaged
