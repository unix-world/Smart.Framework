jQuery Easing Plugin (version 1.3)

Default

Choose a default easing method to overwrite the standard 'swing' animation. The easing default is 'easeOutQuad', specify your own using the following:
jQuery.easing.def = "string";

Where string is one of the equation names. The old swing function is renamed to jswing.
Custom

There are two ways to specify a custom easing method, the following are functionally identical:
$(element).slideUp(1000, method, callback});
$(element).slideUp({
	duration: 1000,
	easing: method,
	complete: callback});

duration: is basically speed, so milliseconds or slow/fast will work here.

easing: takes an ease method see below for options (note to previous users of the plugin this has changed from easeMethod)

callback: takes a pre defined function name or an anonymous function() {} block.

Please note, you can't mix the syntax, use one format or the other, or it won't work properly.
Bonus feature

jQuery.easing.method() All your scripts can use these equations. Call from some kind of time based loop as follows:
jQuery.easing.method(
	nullâ€ ,
	current_time,
	start_value,
	end_value,
	total_time)
