        You need to activate your account before your first login (click on the activation link you will get by email).

    sign-up-reg-step2-1: 'Quick. No activation is required. No password. Based on single use tokens.'
    sign-up-reg-step2-1-desc: |
        SSO Sign-Up is using some well-known federated identity service provider services that will secure exchange your verified identity with this platform.
        Choose with one click one of SSO Identity Providers:
    sign-up-reg-step2-1-hint: 'If you have multiple identities, using different email addresses on different providers, be sure you pick-up the same identity provider each time, otherwise if the email address provided by the SSO identity provider is different than the one you have used to open your account on this platform, you will land into a different account.'
    sign-up-reg-step3: '2FA - Two Factor Authentication'
    sign-up-reg-step3-desc: |
        With 2FA (2-Step pin code Verification), you can add an extra layer of security to your account. After your first login, from your account settings, you can enable the 2FA security option. The 2FA option can also be disabled anytime, if you enabled it.
        Enabling the 2FA option for your account will require on each standard (user / password) Sign-In an extra 8-digit code provided by a 2FA compatible mobile application, where the 2FA code will be installed, such as Google Authenticator or FreeOTP.
        The SSO Authentication will not use the 2FA (if the 2FA option is enabled) because each SSO identity provider is using it's own (optional) mechanism for 2FA.
    sign-up-reg-step4: 'Security and Data Protection'
    sign-up-reg-step4-desc: |
        Nobody except you can access your data. All your sensitive data will be stored as encrypted, using ultra-strong encryption, post-quantum safe algorithms.
        Also, your digital signed data will be preserved safe without modifications. Each account is provided with a unique digital signature.
        All the passwords are encrypted into an irreversible format using the highest security standards. Security is important to you and us.
