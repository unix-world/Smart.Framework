Why a dual license ?
First of all, you have many options.
Second, some modules from the extra project Smart.Framework.Modules requires explicit GPLv3 license to be used.
The BSD licensed parts can be used with GPLv3 licensed parts under a GPLv3 license but the viceversa because of extra restrictions required by the GPLv3 license.
Anyway, all the code in the Smart.Framework standalone project can be used with any of BSD or GPLv3 licenses with no restrictions.
The above explanations refer just if you need to use some modules from the external project Smart.Framework.Modules which may not be BSD licensed but they are explicit GPLv3 licensed.
